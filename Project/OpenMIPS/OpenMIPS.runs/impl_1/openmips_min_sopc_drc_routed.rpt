2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP openmips0/ex0/hilo_temp output openmips0/ex0/hilo_temp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP openmips0/ex0/hilo_temp multiplier stage openmips0/ex0/hilo_temp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net openmips0/id_ex0/ex_aluop_reg[7]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin openmips0/id_ex0/cp0_reg_read_addr_o_reg[4]_i_1/O, cell openmips0/id_ex0/cp0_reg_read_addr_o_reg[4]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net openmips0/mem_wb0/wb_cp0_reg_write_addr_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin openmips0/mem_wb0/cp0_cause_reg[12]_i_1/O, cell openmips0/mem_wb0/cp0_cause_reg[12]_i_1.

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal DDR2/Ram/Inst_DDR/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the DDR2/Ram/Inst_DDR/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of DDR2/Ram/Inst_DDR/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
